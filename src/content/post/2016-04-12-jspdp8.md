I wrote a new emulator for Pdp8 in Javascript to make it more portable and here you can see the result.

You can find the source code on the [js-pdp8 repo](https://github.com/MircoT/js-pdp8) with also the reference and some tips.

The [emulator](https://github.com/MircoT/js-pdp8/tree/master/lib) is separated from the app and can be used with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), furthermore the [app](https://github.com/MircoT/js-pdp8/tree/master/app) is compatible with [NW.js](http://nwjs.io/) and you can start it with that.
 
Now try the example below: click `Compile`, then `Start` and `Run` to see the execution of the source code.
